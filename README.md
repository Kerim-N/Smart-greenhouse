# Smart-greenhouse
This is a smart greenhouse where you can control and see humidity, temperature and water level of plants, also it has solar panel which finds the location of the sun and heading towards the sun. Because of photocells in solar panel we can automatically switch lights on\off. It economs the water by collecting it from rain and snow on roof. Snow and rain on the roof flowing through the pipe and collects in a pool. It maximally economs the electricity by producing it from solar panels, wind turbines and mill which locates between pipe and pool (electricity generates when mill spins because of water which flows through the pipe). It automatically waters and blows on plants. I use RFID to control who can enter the greenhouse.
